# Assignment-4
all the code for assignment 4

Reviewer 1 (Tyler): App looks and runs clean. Would sugest that the user could change the dimensions of the tablet portion of the code. Also, the user could adjust code for whitespace between text and images. Final observation is that the second page could be fixed to have more informative information in a more conservative form. Structured more like a business card. Overall, app looked good and ran.
